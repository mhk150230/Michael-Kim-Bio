# About
Hi! My name is Michael and I am currently an Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles. I expect to complete my Master's degree by December 2020.

Although, I still value experience greatly, this quote really resonates with me when encountering new situations and obstacles.

# Projects
### Real-Time sEMG Gesture Recognition for Remote Expression in Personal Devices and IoT
**Project goal**: Our goal is to create a gesture recognition algorithm for purposes of interfacing sEMG sensors with personal devices and IoT. We believe that today the vast potential of EMG signal for providing convenient and natural way of device control is majorly overlooked. With our project we want to contribute to the field of human biosignals processing, which one day will set a new standards of human-computer communication!

### Eat It!
**Project Goal**: The ease of access to many products have revolutionized the way consumers approach their daily needs. For example, the rise of apps such as GrubHub, Uber Eats, and Postmates have created a networking system that allows for virtually any food to easily arrive at your doorstep. The issue of maintaining a healthy conscious then arises with so much accessibility to restaurants and meals. Few people are aware of what goes into those meals and keeping track of everything can become a hassle. Our application "Eat It!" makes it just as easy to track those meals as it is to order them. Simply give us your dietary preferences or restrictions and hover the camera over your meal. Ingredients, calories, what to eat, and what not to eat all at your fingertips. We make it easy to choose the right option!

### Wearable Playground Sensor for Children in Recovery
**Project Description**: The goal of our project was to create a set of mobile devices for children in recovery that monitored their health and location at a real-time rate. The device consisted of attachments at the wrist and ankle to measure heart rate, location, and acceleration data. 

Features:

- Data is stored and processed externally
- Wireless communication between anchors and ultra-wideband chips were required for real-time data entry
- 3D printed models from SolidWorks were utilized as the shells for the devices
- Matlab post-processing program with GUI 
- Arduino-based mobile data-loggers


# Extracurriculars
When I am not on the job, I enjoy keeping an active lifestyle, playing different sports such as basketball, football, and soccer. I love the competition and fully embrace the opportunity to create lasting friendships through  I also enjoy teaching as I’ve worked as both a private and classroom-based instructor for students as young as the 1st grade. I have also held a position as a teaching assistant (TA) for the "Introduction to Engineering" at the University of Texas at Dallas and look to be the TA for "Mathematics for Scientists" at the University of California, Los Angeles starting January 2020.
