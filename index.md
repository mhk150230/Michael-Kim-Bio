# About
Hi! My name is Michael Kim and I am currently an Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles. I expect to complete my Master's degree by December 2020. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas in May 2019.

Over the past 5 years, I have been blessed to be able to take courses that spark my interest while also focusing on my development as a future engineer. I have had many successes to push me to aspire for more, and I have had many failures to keep myself in check. I'm not afraid to fail, but my mindset is always to succeed. My three strongest attributes are my work ethic, my integrity, and my drive. Each of these traits have helped me get to where I am today, but I know there's more for me to learn!

When I am not on the job, I enjoy keeping an active lifestyle, playing different sports such as basketball, football, and soccer. I love the competition and fully embrace the opportunity to improve every chance I get. I have participated in a handful of basketball tournaments including annual IM brackets for 5v5 and 3v3. 

I also enjoy teaching as I’ve worked as both a private and classroom-based instructor for students as young as the 1st grade. I started out leading summer camps for elementary students starting from the 7th grade, and I have worked as a private instructor for Scholastic Success from 2017 to 2019. More recently, I held a position as a teaching assistant (TA) for the "Introduction to Engineering" at the University of Texas at Dallas in the Fall of 2018 and have been a TA for "Mathematics for Life Scientists" at the University of California, Los Angeles from December 2019 to December 2020. I currently still work with a couple of students privately in order to continue my love for teaching!

# Projects
#### Real-Time sEMG Gesture Recognition for Remote Expression in Personal Devices and IoT
**Project goal**: Our goal is to create a gesture recognition algorithm for purposes of interfacing sEMG sensors with personal devices and IoT. We believe that today the vast potential of EMG signal for providing convenient and natural way of device control is majorly overlooked. With our project we want to contribute to the field of human biosignals processing, which one day will set a new standards of human-computer communication!

#### Eat It!
**Project Goal**: The ease of access to many products have revolutionized the way consumers approach their daily needs. For example, the rise of apps such as GrubHub, Uber Eats, and Postmates have created a networking system that allows for virtually any food to easily arrive at your doorstep. The issue of maintaining a healthy conscious then arises with so much accessibility to restaurants and meals. Few people are aware of what goes into those meals and keeping track of everything can become a hassle. Our application "Eat It!" makes it just as easy to track those meals as it is to order them. Simply give us your dietary preferences or restrictions and hover the camera over your meal. Ingredients, calories, what to eat, and what not to eat all at your fingertips. We make it easy to choose the right option!

#### Wearable Playground Sensor for Children in Recovery (details under Projects)
**Project Description**: The goal of our project was to create a set of mobile devices for children in recovery that monitored their health and location at a real-time rate. The device consisted of attachments at the wrist and ankle to measure heart rate, location, and acceleration data. The project was sponsored by The Texas Scottish Rite Hospital from August 2018 to May 2019. Unfortunately, I am unable to share the work done for this project.

Features:

- Data is stored and processed externally
- Ultra-wideband chips (UWB) for location tracking
- 3D printed models from SolidWorks for device shell
- Matlab post-processing program with GUI 
- Arduino-based mobile data-loggers

#### Classification Analysis on Textual Data
**Project Goal**: Statistical classification refers to the task of identifying a category, from a predefined set, to which a data point belongs, given a training data set with known category memberships. Classification differs from the task of clustering, which concerns grouping data points with no predefined category memberships, where the objective is to seek inherent structures in data with respect to suitable measures. Classification turns out as an essential element of data analysis, especially when dealing with a large amount of data. In this project, we look into different methods for classifying textual data. In this project, the goal includes:

1. To learn how to construct tf-idf representations of textual data.

2. To get familiar with various common classification methods.

3. To learn ways to evaluate and diagnose classification results.

4. To learn two dimensionality reduction methods: PCA & NMF.

5. To get familiar with the complete pipeline of a textual data classification task.

#### Social Distancing Simulator: 2D Planner in a Multi-Agent and Dynamic Environments
**Project Goal**: Path planning in an environment cluttered withmoving obstacles is a challenging and extensively researchedtopic. Mature algorithms in such setting can be deployed tovarious applications in our daily life: household assistance robots,self-driving vehicles, warehouse robots etc. In this paper, wepropose an approach that breaks down the complex setup intotwo separate but interconnected problems: dynamic obstacletrajectory prediction given social context and path planning ofa single robot through an environment with dynamic obstacles.We examined two methods, one is a traditional RRT* and MPCpath planning supplemented with an RNN, and the other isDeep Q-learning. Within a simulated environment, we showedthat using social information for path prediction greatly aids theperformance of robot’s path planner.
