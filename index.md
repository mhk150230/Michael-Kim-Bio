# About
Hi! My name is Michael Kim and I am currently an Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles. I expect to complete my Master's degree by December 2020. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas in May 2019.

Over the past 5 years, I have been blessed to be able to take courses that spark my interest while also focusing on my development as a future engineer. I have had many successes to push me to aspire for more, and I have had many failures to keep myself in check. I'm not afraid to fail, but my mindset is always to succeed. My three strongest attributes are my work ethic, my integrity, and my drive. Each of these traits have helped me get to where I am today, but I know there's more for me to learn!

# Projects
#### Real-Time sEMG Gesture Recognition for Remote Expression in Personal Devices and IoT
**Project goal**: Our goal is to create a gesture recognition algorithm for purposes of interfacing sEMG sensors with personal devices and IoT. We believe that today the vast potential of EMG signal for providing convenient and natural way of device control is majorly overlooked. With our project we want to contribute to the field of human biosignals processing, which one day will set a new standards of human-computer communication!

#### Eat It!
**Project Goal**: The ease of access to many products have revolutionized the way consumers approach their daily needs. For example, the rise of apps such as GrubHub, Uber Eats, and Postmates have created a networking system that allows for virtually any food to easily arrive at your doorstep. The issue of maintaining a healthy conscious then arises with so much accessibility to restaurants and meals. Few people are aware of what goes into those meals and keeping track of everything can become a hassle. Our application "Eat It!" makes it just as easy to track those meals as it is to order them. Simply give us your dietary preferences or restrictions and hover the camera over your meal. Ingredients, calories, what to eat, and what not to eat all at your fingertips. We make it easy to choose the right option!

#### Wearable Playground Sensor for Children in Recovery
**Project Description**: The goal of our project was to create a set of mobile devices for children in recovery that monitored their health and location at a real-time rate. The device consisted of attachments at the wrist and ankle to measure heart rate, location, and acceleration data. The project was sponsored by The Texas Scottish Rite Hospital from August 2018 to May 2019. Unfortunately, I am unable to share the work done for this project.

Features:

- Data is stored and processed externally
- Ultra-wideband chips (UWB) for location tracking
- 3D printed models from SolidWorks for device shell
- Matlab post-processing program with GUI 
- Arduino-based mobile data-loggers


# Extracurriculars
When I am not on the job, I enjoy keeping an active lifestyle, playing different sports such as basketball, football, and soccer. I love the competition and fully embrace the opportunity to improve every chance I get. I have participated in a handful of basketball tournaments including annual IM brackets for 5v5 and 3v3. From my love for competition also stems my guilty pleasure: League of Legends. Although I haven't yet reached my goal, I hope to make an appearance as a challenger player at some point. Unfortunately with other priorities in the way, this will have to wait. 

I also enjoy teaching as I’ve worked as both a private and classroom-based instructor for students as young as the 1st grade. I started out leading summer camps for elementary students starting from the 7th grade, and more recently, I worked as a private instructor for Scholastic Success. I have also held a position as a teaching assistant (TA) for the "Introduction to Engineering" at the University of Texas at Dallas and look to be the TA for "Mathematics for Scientists" at the University of California, Los Angeles starting January 2020. I plan to continue teaching so long as the opportunity remains at my doorstep!

# My Role Model
Kobe. Bean. Bryant. 

The man is an unstoppable force in the game of basketball. If you pressure him at the top, he'll go by you. If you give him the shot, he's going to take it. He's got handles, he can pass, he can shoot. If you want it bad, just know that so does he. There is nothing this man won't do to win. Kobe Bryant is a phenomenal basketball player, but what draws me to him the most is what he does to get there: the work ethic, the passion, the hunger, and the perserverance. There's an aura about Kobe that I can't describe, but there's no doubt about it- it's got something to do with the number 5.

# My Favorite Quotes
> "I truly believe experience is necessary for those who are unqualified. 
> So in other words, if you’re not qualified to do it, you need that experience."
> - Russell Wilson

Don't get me wrong, I still value experience! However, there's much more new experiences to come; this quote will continue to push me as I encounter new situations and grow as an individual!

> "Everything negative - pressures, challenges - is all an opportunity for me to rise"
> - Kobe Bryant
