# About
Hi! My name is Michael and I am currently an M. Eng. candidate for Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles. I expect to complete my degree by December 2020.

Although, I still value experience greatly, this quote really resonates with me when encountering new situations and obstacles.

# Extracurriculars
When I am not on the job, I enjoy keeping an active lifestyle, playing different sports such as basketball, football, and soccer. I love the competition and fully embrace the opportunity to create lasting friendships through  I also enjoy teaching as I’ve worked as both a private and classroom-based instructor for students as young as the 1st grade. I have also held a position as a teaching assistant (TA) for the "Introduction to Engineering" at the University of Texas at Dallas and look to be the TA for "Mathematics for Scientists" at the University of California, Los Angeles starting January 2020.
